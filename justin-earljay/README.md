# Project Name: Lab 06

**Author**: Justin Morris, Earl Jay Caoile
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This app displays blog articles from a database. It is then saved to local storage, so the user can browser even faster on subsequent reloads. In order that the user has to up to date information, we cached ETags from the server so that we can compare the user's stored articles to the server's articles.

## Getting Started
The user must download all of the files from our repository.

## Architecture
This app uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Libraries include jQuery, Handlebars, Highlight, and Marked. Using AJAX requests, we retrieved the current article data from the server.
